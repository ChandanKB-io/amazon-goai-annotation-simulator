# Amazon GO-AI Annotation Simulator

## 📌 Project Objective
This project is a simulation of Amazon’s GO-AI video annotation process, designed to replicate how fulfillment centers track accuracy, SOP compliance, and operational KPIs.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (OpenCV)
- Excel (KPI tracking)
- LabelImg (for real annotation practice)
- Google Sheets (optional, for performance logging)

## 🔧 Features
- Manual video/image annotation simulation
- Accuracy benchmarking
- Productivity tracking using Excel
- SOP checklist for consistency

## 📁 Files
- `main.py`: Simulates annotation logic using OpenCV
- `kpi_tracker.xlsx`: Spreadsheet to track daily performance
- `sample_frame.jpg`: Sample image (to be added)

## 🧪 How to Use
1. Open `main.py` and follow the comments to simulate annotation
2. Use `kpi_tracker.xlsx` to manually enter accuracy, speed, and notes
3. Update the README with any new insights or screenshots

## 🚀 Status
MVP prototype ready. Currently building more frames and tracker automation.

## 🧠 Learning Outcome
- Real-world simulation of data operations
- Understanding of SOP tracking and ML workflow support
- Portfolio-ready project aligned with Amazon GO-AI expectations
